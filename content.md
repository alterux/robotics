# Modularity at Ningen Robotics

Our engineering vision focuses on three core principles: simplicity, modularity, and customizability.

## Simplicity

We strive for elegant, straightforward designs that are easy to understand and maintain. By using only the essential sensors and leveraging intelligent software, each component is used to its fullest potential.

## Modularity

Our robots are built with interchangeable components, allowing for easy upgrades and customization. This modular design allows customers to adapt their robots to fit their specific needs and applications.

## Customizability

We empower our customers to tailor our robots to their specific requirements. From hardware to software, every aspect of our robots can be modified to enhance functionality and usability.

# Master Plan

At Ningen Robotics, we have a clear roadmap for the future of robotics deployment. We follow a strategic 3-step plan for the deployment of our technology over the next five years.

## Our Core Principles
- **Simplicity**: We strive for elegant, straightforward designs that are easy to understand and maintain.
- **Modularity**: Our robots are built with interchangeable components, allowing for easy upgrades and customization.
- **Customizability**: We empower our customers to tailor our robots to their specific needs and applications.

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Academia and R&D
In the first phase, we deploy the H1 robot to academia and private R&D sectors. The H1's ease of repair and open design makes it ideal for various research institutions within the field of robotics and embodied AI. Feedback and analytics gathered in this phase will help us improve the physical design and iterate on its functionality.

### Phase 2: Industry and Government
Once the H1 robot is deemed robust enough for real-world use, we move to the second phase, targeting industry and government sectors. Here, the focus will be on deploying robots that can enhance productivity and safety in industrial settings and public services.

### Phase 3: General Consumer Market
The final phase involves the deployment of our robots to the general consumer market, making advanced robotics accessible to everyday users. This phase will focus on user-friendly designs and intuitive interfaces to ensure seamless integration into daily life.

## Software Integration

During these phases, we will also develop the S1 operating system, a highly generalized OS designed to run on a variety of hardware. Collaborations with large AI companies will ensure that cutting-edge AI techniques are integrated into our OS, enhancing the capabilities of our robots.
